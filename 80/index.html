            <h3>Vendor Notes</h3>
            <p>City+ roasts brought molasses bread-like sweetness to the dry fragrance, with dark sugar and savory almond notes. Full City strung together more of a cocoa roast matrix, along with hints of toasted grain. The wet aroma was laced with a fragrant sweetness of almond pastry made with marzipan. The brew had approachable bittersweet cocoa flavors that carried the cup. It's sweet, uncomplicated, and should garner broad appeal. City+ is the best place to start, but don't shy away from roasting this coffee to 2nd Crack if that's what you prefer. My dark roast had dense body, and intense bittersweet chocolate that was rich and delicious on its own, but would also pair well with milk. City+ roasts had the sweetness of malt syrup, old fashioned molasses cake, with a hint of spice, and milk chocolate finish. This will make a nice espresso, and would also function well as a blend base.</p>
            <p>This organic Chiapas coffee comes from a producer co-operative called Siembra Abundante, in San Cristobal de Las Casas, which is also known by its Tzotzil name, Valley de Jovel. The Mayan Tzotzil people are the predominant indigenous goup in Tenejapa, and produce much of the coffee in this region. Farms are very small, typically 2 hectares of coffee or less. Altitude in the Jovel valley reaches 1350 meters above sea level, and farms are planted in a mix of cultivars, such as older Typica types, Caturra, Marsallesa, and Costa Rica 95. Coffee is home processed, meaning each farmer is responsible for processing their harvest down to dried green seeds (with the parchment layer) before delivering it to the local mill where it is prepared for export. Processing small batches in heterogenous way like this can lead to a range of profiles from one farm to the next, and often helps bring complexity to blends. We found this community blend offered structured acidity and mild top notes when roasted light. It's a definite 'crowd pleasing' coffee, and can also be roasted dark for hefty chocolate roast flavors that will work well in espresso.</p>

            <h2>How to Read the Roast Profile Chart</h2>
            <p>The roast profile chart visualizes the transformation of the coffee beans during the roasting process. Here's how to interpret the chart:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bean Temperature (BT):</strong> The main line showing the actual temperature of the coffee beans over time.</li>
                <li><strong>Rate of Rise (RoR):</strong> Indicates the rate at which the bean temperature is increasing. A declining RoR is typical in a well-controlled roast.</li>
                <li><strong>Drum Temperature (DT):</strong> Represents the temperature inside the roaster drum.</li>
                <li><strong>Power, Fan, and Drum Speed Settings:</strong> Displayed as step lines showing adjustments made during the roast to control the heat application and airflow.</li>
                <li><strong>Key Phases:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Drying Phase:</strong> From the start until the beans turn yellow. Moisture is being removed.</li>
                        <li><strong>Maillard Phase:</strong> Beans begin to brown due to sugar caramelization and Maillard reactions.</li>
                        <li><strong>First Crack:</strong> Beans expand and release steam, marking the start of development phase.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Understanding this chart helps in appreciating the craft that goes into roasting your coffee to perfection.</p>
