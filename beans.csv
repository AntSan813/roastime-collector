This wet-processed coffee offers a clean, well-balanced cup with rich sweetness and a full body","Espresso, Pour Over, and French Press",February 2024,Grade 1,TRUE,87,,"Cirambai makes such a pleasant brewed coffee, the kind I want to drink on the daily! Complex bittersweet flavors sit well with caramel-sweetness, and the combo of milder acidity and big body make it a really nice dual-use coffee for espresso too. The fragrance of the ground coffee had milk chocolate, and brown sugar, with an hint of vanilla. The wetted crust had a scent of crisped caramel, like creme brûlée topping. At City roast level, the cup had very clean sweetness, with flavors of brown sugar, caramel, and sweet cream filling out the substantial bodied brew. The flavors reminded me of Coffee Nips candies, if you've ever tried them, a coffee-flavored hard candy that's caramely and sweet. Full City roasting developed very nice cocoa roast flavors, with an accent note of cedar smoke in the finish.","This wet process lot is from a few cherry collectors located in Patuha region of Ciwidey. ""Collectors"" are intermediaries of sorts who buy partially processed coffee and full coffee cherry from small scale farmers and then often process the coffee down to the dried seed/bean. Two of them may be familiar names by now, since we've carried their coffees individually on our site, Haji Iyan, and Pak Gunawan. Whereas many collectors create large blends of all the coffee they buy, Iyan and Gunawan pay special attention to separating by region, these smaller lot sizes adding a layer of quality control, not to mention more specific provenance. Most of the coffee in this lot is from around the villages of Tambak Ruyung, Patuha, and Indragiri. Farms span an altitude range of 1500 to 1800 meters, and typical varieties grown are Ateng types like Sigarar Uteng, and older Typicas. This is a fully washed coffee, which is pretty common in Java. The cup flavors come off very clean, and well-balanced, and in many ways, not unlike a clean washed Central American coffee."

This organic coffee offers rich sweetness with cocoa and nutty flavors, perfect for a variety of roast levels","Espresso, Pour Over, and Drip",July 2024,SHG,TRUE,86.5,Organic,"City+ roasts brought molasses bread-like sweetness to the dry fragrance, with dark sugar and savory almond notes. Full City strung together more of a cocoa roast matrix, along with hints of toasted grain. The wet aroma was laced with a fragrant sweetness of almond pastry made with marzipan. The brew had approachable bittersweet cocoa flavors that carried the cup. It's sweet, uncomplicated, and should garner broad appeal. City+ is the best place to start, but don't shy away from roasting this coffee to 2nd Crack if that's what you prefer. My dark roast had dense body, and intense bittersweet chocolate that was rich and delicious on its own, but would also pair well with milk. City+ roasts had the sweetness of malt syrup, old fashioned molasses cake, with a hint of spice, and milk chocolate finish. This will make a nice espresso, and would also function well as a blend base.","This organic Chiapas coffee comes from a producer co-operative called Siembra Abundante, in San Cristobal de Las Casas, which is also known by its Tzotzil name, Valley de Jovel. The Mayan Tzotzil people are the predominant indigenous goup in Tenejapa, and produce much of the coffee in this region. Farms are very small, typically 2 hectares of coffee or less. Altitude in the Jovel valley reaches 1350 meters above sea level, and farms are planted in a mix of cultivars, such as older Typica types, Caturra, Marsallesa, and Costa Rica 95. Coffee is home processed, meaning each farmer is responsible for processing their harvest down to dried green seeds (with the parchment layer) before delivering it to the local mill where it is prepared for export. Processing small batches in heterogenous way like this can lead to a range of profiles from one farm to the next, and often helps bring complexity to blends. We found this community blend offered structured acidity and mild top notes when roasted light. It's a definite 'crowd pleasing' coffee, and can also be roasted dark for hefty chocolate roast flavors that will work well in espresso."

This versatile wet-processed coffee is balanced with sweet, nutty flavors and a smooth finish","Espresso, Pour Over, and Drip",July 2024,SHB EP,TRUE,86.8,,"This coffee from San Martin Jilotepeque is a simple, delicious ""every day"" type coffee, bittersweet and balanced in middle-to-dark roasts, with subtle top notes impacting the cup. The aroma at City roast level has a smell of sweet smell of cinnamon-sugar toast, with hints of caramel and maple, roasted nuts, and Ibarra type drinking cocoa. The flavors in the brewed coffee of middle roasts are sturdy, with rounded sweetness, and a nice balance of low tones and acidity. I pick up on notes of brown sugar, milk chocolate, pecan, and a very mild herbal hint in the lightest roasts. The cup acidity at City/City+ is quite nice and brings an aspect of black tea to the brew. Full City+ roasts have intense cocoa flavors, lightly sweetened with unrefined sugars, and a note of chocolate taffy. San Martin Jilotepeque is an incredibly versatile coffee, with a lot to offer at a variety of roast levels and will show well under any brew method, including espresso.","This lot is made up from the coffee of several small holders in and around the town of San Martin Jilotepeque, about 2 hours south of Antigua, in Guatemala's Chimaltenango Municipality. The group of farmers who are part of this buying project are banded together around Chepe Garcia, a local farmer himself, who's taken the job of organizing and collecting coffee cherry to be sold. Unlike some of the other Guatemala buying projects we are a part of, this one differs in that the coffee is sold by Chepe in whole cherry, not parchment. So instead of each individual lot being processed by the farmer, they are all mixed together each week and delivered to a coffee mill in nearby Antigua where it's processed. Starting with whole cherry, the mill has an added layer of control over isolating the coffee by grade, making sure that only ripe cherry makes it into the top grades. They remove the over-ripe and uder-ripe coffee using methods like floatation before the coffee is depulped, and then long washing channels after fermentation. San Martin Jilotepeque town is at about 1800 meters and Chepe's farm that we visited, Finca Magnolia, tops out at just over 1900 meters."

The Gitwe mill’s first natural process coffee","Espresso, Pour Over, and French Press",January 2024,A1,TRUE,88,,"Fruit flavors come through in Gitwe's cup, but not without bittersweet intensity, and heavy body too. The fragrance of the dry grounds have a scent of stewed fruits, like peach, and berry, along with a note of buckwheat pancakes. The wet aroma carried notes of dried strawberry and cantaloupe, rustic cocoa, and sorghum sugar. At City+, the cup brought a moderate level of acidity for a dry process coffee, which underscored some of the more fleshy fruit flavors. ""Strawberry"" was a note that we landed on in terms of flavor, as well as the type of acidic impression we picked up on in the brew. The coffee cooled to notes of dried blueberry and peach, with rustic cocoa accents, chocolate-covered cherry, and some woody spice notes. Full City roasts are deep-toned, but also quite juicy with underlying berry aspects. Dry Process Gitwe gets my enthusiastic endorsement as espresso too, with Full City being a good roast level starting point. I pulled a shot at 5 days rest (18g in, 18g out) and was pleased with a subtly tart huckleberry note that percolated up from within a blanket of high % cacao chocolate flavors, fading to chocolate-covered coconut in the aftertaste.","The Gitwe coffee mill is located in Rwanda's southern Nyamasheke District. Gitwe sits at roughly 1800 meters above sea level, and the farms of the 800 outgrowers who deliver their coffee to Gitwe are situated between 1800 and 2000 meters. This is a dry process coffee, our first from Gitwe. This means that the whole coffee cherry is dried intact, seed, fruit, and all. Typically, it take twice as long to dry a dry process (""natural"") coffee, and can lead to heavy fruit flavors in the cup, along with lower acidity, and body. We found Gitwe had a very nice array of rustic fruits, and also presented an impressive acidic impression considering the process. I roasted Gitwe to light and medium roast levels, and found that Full City roasting flattens out acidity a bit, which worked really well as espresso! Dry process coffees also produce more chaff during roasting, which is something to keep an eye on between batches. If you're roasting in a Behmor, I would limit batch size to around 300 grams in order to avoid chaff smoldering on the quartz burners."
